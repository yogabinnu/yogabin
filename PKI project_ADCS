Project: Implementing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) using Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)

Overview

I implemented a complete Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) setup by installing and configuring Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) on Windows Server 2022.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with enterprise-level security infrastructure, certificate authorities, and server configurations.



Implementing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) using ADCS

Objective:

To design, configure, and validate a fully functional PKI environment by deploying a Root Certification Authority (CA) using ADCS.

Environment / Tools Used

Windows Server 2022

Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)

Server Manager



This project showcases in:

Implementing PKI security

Working with Windows Server roles

Configuring enterprise security infrastructure

Understanding certificate-based authentication and encryption







Steps I Performed

1️⃣ Installing Certificate Services

Opened Server Manager and launched Add Roles and Features.

Selected Role-based installation and the server from the pool.

Chose Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) and enabled required management tools.

Kept default features and continued with the installation.

Selected Certification Authority (CA) as the role service.

Allowed automatic server restart and completed installation.



2️⃣ Configuring Active Directory Certificate Services

Completed post-deployment configuration using the yellow notification flag in Server Manager.

Verified credentials and proceeded with configuration.

Selected:

Certification Authority

Standalone CA

Root CA

Created a new private key and selected the default cryptographic provider.

Specified a custom CA name.

Changed the default certificate validity period from 5 years to 1 year.

Accepted default database locations.

Completed and verified CA configuration.



Below are the PKI configuration steps with corresponding screenshots.

Step 1: Open Server Manager and start Add Roles and Features.



Step 2: Choose Role-based installation.



Step 3: Select server from pool.



Step 4: Select Active Directory Certificate Services role.



Step 5: Add required features for ADCS.



Step 6: Confirm role selection.



Step 7: Install Certification Authority role service.



Step 8: Complete installation.



Step 9: Start ADCS post-deployment configuration.



Step 10: Choose Certification Authority.



Step 11: Select Standalone CA.



Step 12: Select Root CA.



Step 13:Install the selected certificate 



Step 14: install completed



Step 15: 



Step 16: Set validity period to 1 year.



Step 17: Assign CA name. 



Step 18: Confirm and configure CA.



Step 19 : Specificy the type of CA



Step 20 :.Create a new private key.



Step 21. Choose cryptographic provider.



Step 22 : provide the CA name



Step 23: Certificate validity period – We’ll ensure this aligns with organization compliance retention policy



Step 24:        Accept database locations.



Step 25 Provide confirmation



Step 26: Active Directory certificate services installed successfuly



Outcome

Successfully deployed a fully functional Root Certification Authority for issuing and managing digital certificates.
This project strengthened my understanding of:

PKI concepts

Certificate issuance and lifecycle

Root CA management

Windows Server security components
